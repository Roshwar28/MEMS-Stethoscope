# MEMS-Stethoscope
"Design and Implementation of a MEMS-Based Mechanical Stethoscope using MATLAB."
Problem Statement:Traditional stethoscopes struggle with sensitivity, sound clarity, and
noise filtering, leading to potential misdiagnosis. A more advanced solution is needed to
improve diagnostic accuracy and portability
Objective:
● Capture sound vibrations produced by the human body and convert them into electrical
signals for further analysis.
● Improve sound sensitivity and clarity.
● Use digital signal processing for noise reduction.
